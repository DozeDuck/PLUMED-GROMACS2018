The input trajectory can be in any of the following formats: 

                  ATOMS - atoms for which we calculate the density map, typically all 
                          heavy atoms. For more information on how to specify lists of 
                          atoms see \ref Group 

The following arguments are compulsory: 

               GMM_FILE - file with the parameters of the GMM components 
                   TEMP - temperature 
              NL_CUTOFF - The cutoff in overlap for the neighbor list 
              NL_STRIDE - The frequency with which we are updating the neighbor list 
             SIGMA_MEAN - starting value for the uncertainty in the mean estimate 

In addition you may use the following options: 

  NUMERICAL_DERIVATIVES - ( default=off ) calculate the derivatives for these 
                          quantities numerically 
                  NOPBC - ( default=off ) ignore the periodic boundary conditions 
                          when calculating distances 
                NO_AVER - ( default=off ) don't do ensemble averaging in 
                          multi-replica mode 
               ANALYSIS - ( default=off ) run in analysis mode
